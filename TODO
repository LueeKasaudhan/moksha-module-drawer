First, make everything fully functional.

Test blacklist functionality to the history plugin.
Finish blacklist edit functions and figure out the smart object error:
   ERR<1373>:evas_main ../src/lib/evas/canvas/evas_object_smart.c:151 evas_object_smart_data_get() calling smart object API on non-smart object!

Original To Do list:

Thumbnailing needs a LOT more work

D&D actions

Horizontal list needs a way to show the category name

The grid view should handle categories

A gadman-like view/source plugin might be a good idea (for gadgets in a popup)

Python plugins? (3 vs 2.x?)


*** Wishlist ***

An edje overlay would be better than the current context menu
