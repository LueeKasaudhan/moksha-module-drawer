Everything should be fully functional now and converted to meson build.

BUT thumbnailing is significantly broke so for now is disabled in the build. 
Do NOT compile with thumbnailing support unless you are prepared for segfaults 
and other issues.

Bodhi To Do list:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix Thumbnailing

use eina_string share in hist blacklist code
Finish blacklist edit functions and figure out the smart object error:
   ERR<1373>:evas_main ../src/lib/evas/canvas/evas_object_smart.c:151 evas_object_smart_data_get() calling smart object API on non-smart object!

Directory_ watcher Plugin should have right click option to open or open with on drawer_item.
This is prob pretty hard.

Ideas on future plugins:
- gtk-recently used?
- ?? 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original To Do list:

Thumbnailing needs a LOT more work

D&D actions

Horizontal list needs a way to show the category name

The grid view should handle categories

A gadman-like view/source plugin might be a good idea (for gadgets in a popup)

Python plugins? (3 vs 2.x?)


*** Wishlist ***

An edje overlay would be better than the current context menu
