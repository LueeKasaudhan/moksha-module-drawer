First, make everything fully functional.

Test blacklist functionality to the history plugin.
Add an ibar like way to edit Blacklist file items, maybe advanced button

Original To Do list:

Thumbnailing needs a LOT more work

D&D actions

Horizontal list needs a way to show the category name

The grid view should handle categories

A gadman-like view/source plugin might be a good idea (for gadgets in a popup)

Python plugins? (3 vs 2.x?)


*** Wishlist ***

An edje overlay would be better than the current context menu
